During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **06/08/2025** to **12/24/2025**, I have learned so many things in the cloud domain and I felt grateful for all the time I spent in this program.

My team and I started **Smart Office Project**. From this project, I know more about the basic of many AWS Services such as **Event Bridge**, **Lambda**, **SNS** and **IoT Core**, as well as acquire a good grasp on the work flow of AWS architecture. Those knowledge will assist me strongly in my future endeavours.

In the project, I tried to complete my task dutifully, and also put myself in uncharted territory by learning to use more advanced features of some AWS Services, such ass **Fleet Provisioning** of **AWS IoT Core**.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
